  "summary": "All requirements have been successfully implemented. The diff shows a complete implementation of the daily reflection feature including: backend data model with migration support, DailyReflection component with Sanskrit headers, React Query hooks with auto-save functionality, and integration into DateDetailsPanel. All acceptance criteria are satisfied with evidence in the code.",

      "description": "Auto-save functionality with 1-second debounce in DailyReflection component",
      "reason": "The BuildRequest explicitly lists 'Rich text editing or formatting in reflection text area' as a non-goal, but does not mention auto-save. The implementation includes automatic saving with a 1-second timeout after text changes, which was not requested in any requirement or acceptance criteria. REQ-22 only states 'Reflection saves properly when text area is modified' without specifying auto-save behavior.",

      "reason": "While the component shows a loading spinner (Loader2) during save operations, this specific UI indicator was not requested in the requirements. REQ-19 specifies the component structure and REQ-21 mentions toast notifications for success/error states, but does not mention inline loading indicators.",

REQ-20 only requests functions to 'save and retrieve reflection notes by date' - specifically set/update and retrieve by date. A function to retrieve all reflections was not requested.",
